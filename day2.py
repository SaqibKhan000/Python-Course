# Variables in Python
a = 1
print(a)

name = 'M Saqib Kha'
print(name) 

num = 50
print(num + 10)


# Multiple variables initialization:
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
print(x, y, z)


# Variable casing in Python:
MyName = "M Saqib Khan" # pascal case
myName = "M Saqib Khan" # camel case
myname = "M Saqib Khan" # flat case
my_name = "M Saqib Khan" # snake case



# Rules for variables in Python:
# 1) Variables must start from a letter like (a, b, c....z) or underscore (_).
# 2) Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscore.
# 3) Here varibales are case-sensitive.
# 4) Variable names can't be reserved words.
