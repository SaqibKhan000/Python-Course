# We Have Total Seven (7) Operators In Python:


# 1) ARITHMATIC OPERATOR:
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
print(num1 + num2) # Addition Operator
print(num1 - num2) # Subtraction Operator
print(num1 * num2) # Multiplication Operator
print(num1 / num2) # Division Operator
print(num1 // num2) # Floor Division Operator
print(num1 % num2) # Modulus Operator
print(num1 ** num2) # Exponentiation Operator




# 2) ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:
num3 = 8 # Assignment Operator (=)
num3 += 1 # Assignment Operator (+=) 
num3 -= 1 # Assignment Operator (-=) 
num3 *= 1 # Assignment Operator (*=) 
num3 /= 1 # Assignment Operator (/=) 
num3 %= 1 # Assignment Operator (%=) 
num3 //= 1 # Assignment Operator (//=) 





# 3) COMPARISON OR RELATIONAL OPERATOR:
num4 = 8
num5 = 5
print(num4 == num5) # equal to 
print(num4 != num5) # not equal to
print(num4 > num5) # greater than
print(num4 < num5) # less than
print(num4 >= num5) # greater than or equal to
print(num4 <= num5) # less than or equal to





# 4) LOGICAL OPERATOR:
num6 = 15
num7 = 10
print((num6 > num7) and (num7 < num6)) # and operator
print((num6 > num7) or (num7 > num6))  # or operator
print(not(num6 > num7)) # not operator
